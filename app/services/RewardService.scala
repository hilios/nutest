/**
  * This class calculates the points earned by users based on the number of invites they did.
  *
  * The inviter gets (1/2)^k points for each confirmed invitation, where k is the level of the
  * invitation: level 0 (people directly invited) yields 1 point, level 1 (people invited by someone
  * invited by the original customer) gives 1/2 points, level 2 invitations (people invited by
  * someone on level 1) awards 1/4 points and so on. Only the first invitation counts: multiple
  * invites sent to the same person don't produce any further points, even if they come from
  * different inviters.
  *
  * Also, to count as a valid invitation, the invited customer must have invited someone (so
  * customers that didn't invite anyone don't count as points for the customer that invited them).
